Welcome to avro-schema's documentation. Thanks for checking it out!

This is a library containing declarations of the
[Avro specification](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html)
in Rust's struct and enums together with serialization and deserialization
implementations based on `serde_json`.

It also contains basic functionality to read and deserialize Avro's file's metadata
and blocks.
